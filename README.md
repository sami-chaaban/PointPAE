# PointPAE

Use this script to map AlphaFold's predicted aligned error (PAE) of one residue onto the whole model. It generates a Chimera attribute file for each chain that represents the PAE values of the residue.

Edit the variables in the script and run it with `python PointPAE.py`. Make sure you are using python>=3.6.
