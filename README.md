Use this notebook to map Alphafold's predicted aligned error (PAE) of a single residue onto the model. It generates a Chimera attribute file for each chain that represents the PAE values (y-axis) of the residue.

## Instructions

* Edit the variables in the script and run it with `python PointPAE.py`. Make sure you are using python>=3.6.
